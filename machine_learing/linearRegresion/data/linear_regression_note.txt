# Linnear regression

## 1: Least squares method
* minimizing the sum of squares of the residuals
* residual for an observation is the difference between the observation(y-vaalue) and teh fitted line

### regression evaluation

#### Mean Absolute Error
* this is the mean of the absolue value of  errors
* easy to understand, just average error

#### Mean Squared Error 
* this is themean of the squared  errors
* larger errors are noted more than with ma, making MSE more popular

#### Root Mean Square Error
* this is the root of the mean of the squared errors
*  most popular(has  same units as y)

#### R Squared Values
* also known as the coefficient of determination
* not quite an error metric, more of a statical measure of your regression model
* by itself it wont tell you the whole story
* its a measure of how much variance your model accounts for
* between 0-1(o% to 100%)
*  there are also different ways of obtaining r^2 such as adjusted R squared
