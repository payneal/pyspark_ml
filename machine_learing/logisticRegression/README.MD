# notes
* not all  lables are continuous, somethings you need to predict categories, this is known as classification
* logistic regression is one of the basic wasy to perform classification(dont be confused by the word "regression")
logistic regression allows us to solve classification problems where we are trying to predict discrete categories
* sections 4-4.3 of Introduction  to statistiucal learning by Gareth James et al.
*the convention for binary classification is to have two classes 0 and 1
## examples of classificattion problems
* spam versus "ham" email
* loan default(yes/no)
* disease diagnosis
* above were binary classification examples
## sigmoid function 
* the sigmoid (aka Logistic) function takes in any value and outputs it to be between 0 and 1
## Confusion Matrix
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix
* type 1 error = false positive = telling a man he is pregnant 
* type 2 errro = false negitive = telling a pregnant women she is not prego when sh actually is

## binary classification
* has its own special classification metrics
* include visualization of metrics from the confusion matrix 
* The Receiver Operator Curve(ROC) curve was developed durring WW2 to help analyze radar data
